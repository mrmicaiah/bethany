# BEHAVIOR PATTERNS

This document defines when and how the character acts — their rhythms, triggers, and response patterns. This is the difference between a character who waits to be spoken to and one who feels alive.

- [ ] Time-based (morning, evening, etc.)
- [ ] Gap-based (after X hours of silence)
- [ ] Event-based (something happened)
- [ ] Random/spontaneous
- [ ] Emotional (thinking of them)

```
[Define the triggers]
```
